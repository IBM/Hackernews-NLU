# Hackernews-NLU

Hackernews-NLU is a sample application that uses Watson Natural Language Understanding service to analyze the contents of trending news articles on Hackernews to give information about the concepts, entities, categories, keywords, sentiment, emotion etc. about the news article.

## Application Workflow Diagram
![Application Workflow](images/archi.png)

* The user deploys the application to bluemix.
* Application loads the data from the Hackernews API.
* The user interacts with the application UI using their browser.
* When the user performs any action, UI calls the server application API which uses the Watson NLU service to analyze the respective news article.

## Included Components
- Bluemix Watson Natural Language Understanding service
- Hackernews API

## Deploying the Application to Bluemix

You can deploy the application using any one of the following ways:
- Deploy to Bluemix button
- Bluemix command line

### a) Using the Deploy to Bluemix button
Clicking on the button below creates a Bluemix DevOps Toolchain and deploys this application to Bluemix. The `manifest.yml` file [included in the repo] is parsed to obtain the name of the application, configuration details, and the list of services that should be provisioned. For further details on the structure of the `manifest.yml` file, see the [Cloud Foundry documentation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#minimal-manifest).

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://metrics-tracker.mybluemix.net/stats/47c4243d2ddb563afd98dcc8f44d689d/button.svg)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/Hackernews-NLU.git)

Once deployment to Bluemix is completed, you can view the deployed application and services from your bluemix account.

### b) Using the Bluemix command line
You can also manually deploy the Hackernews-NLU app to Bluemix. Though not as magical as using the Bluemix button above, manually deploying the app gives you some insights about what is happening behind the scenes. Remember that you'd need the Bluemix [command line](http://clis.ng.bluemix.net/ui/home.html) installed on your system to deploy the app to Bluemix.

Execute the following command to clone the Git repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/Hackernews-NLU.git
```

Go to the project's root folder on your system and execute the `Cloud-Scripts/services/services.sh` script to create the service Hackernews-NLU depends on. Please note that you should have logged on to Bluemix before attempting to execute this script. For information on how to log in, see the Bluemix [documentation](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/install_cli.html).

Executing the `Cloud-Scripts/services/services.sh` script should result in output similar to this:

```bash
$ Cloud-Scripts/services/services.sh
Creating service...
Invoking 'cf create-service natural-language-understanding free Hackernews-NLU'...

Creating service instance Hackernews-NLU in org ishan.gulhane@ibm.com / space dev as ishan.gulhane@ibm.com...
OK
Service created.
```

After the service is created, you can issue the `bx app push` command from the project's root folder to deploy the Swift-Enterprise-Demo application to Bluemix.

```bash
$ bx app push
Invoking 'cf push'...

Once the application is running on Bluemix, you can access your application assigned URL (i.e. route). To find the route, you can log on to your [Bluemix account](https://console.ng.bluemix.net), or you can inspect the output from the execution of the `bx app push` or `bx app show <application name>` commands. The string value shown next to the `urls` field contains the assigned route.  Use that route as the URL to access the sample server using the browser of your choice.

```bash
$ bx app show HackernewsNLU
Invoking 'cf app HackernewsNLU'...

## Privacy Notice
The sample application includes code to track deployments to [IBM Cloud](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM/metrics-collector-service) service on each deployment:

* Swift project code version (if provided)
* Swift project repository URL
* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels and names of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the parameters of the `MetricsTrackerClient`, the `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables in IBM Cloud and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Cloud to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.
